# AOC - Day 2

This is my solution for day 2 of Advent of Code 2020. And today we are using [Clojure](https://clojure.org/).

## How to

Just run it with `lein run` or `lein repl` to try the functions in the REPL.

## Overall impression

I really like the language. It's a Lisp, so it's a bit different from what I'm used to, but it's really nice. I like the syntax, I like the way it works, I like the way it's structured. I'm not sure if I'll use it for anything else, but I'll definitely keep it in mind.

- Pain points:

  - Debugging is terrible and the error messages are not helpful at all.
  - The Calva extension for VSCode is a bit overwelming and I was not able to propperly configure it to work with my project.

- Good things:
  - Lisp syntax is really nice.
  - The language flows really well.

Do not imagine using this to write a web app, but for scripting and data processing it's really nice.
