# AOC - Day 06

This is my solution for day 06 of Advent of Code 2022. And today we are using [Mojo](https://www.modular.com/mojo).

## How to

Just run it with `mojo aoc.ðŸ”¥`.

## Overall impression

I'm digging the syntax. It's very similar to Python, but with all the things I love about the Rust syntax. It feels familiar enough, but it's also different enough to be interesting. But it's definitely too early to say more than that.

### Pain points

- The docs are not very good. I had to look at the source code to figure out how to do some things.
- The language is still on beta, so there are some bugs with syntax and the LSP.
- After some days using Elixir the examples in the docs really feel lacking.

### Good things

- The syntax is really nice, like really really nice, probably my favorite take on python-like syntax.
- The stdlib feels really AI focused for now, but sounds like it will be pretty complete in the future.
- The language flows really well and it's fast, feels fast.

I'll definitely keep it in mind for the future. In some months to years this will for sure be relevant, for scripting I would probably use it over python, the compiler, LSP and the syntax are just too good to pass, everything is integrated was definitely easier than python and it's 34 tools I had to install to get a decent experience.
