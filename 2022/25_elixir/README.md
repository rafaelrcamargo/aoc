# AOC - Day 25

This is my solution for day 25 of Advent of Code 2022. And today we are using [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). (I definitely did not mistakenly did the day 25 instead of day 3... cof cof)

## How to

Just run it with `mix run` or `iex` to try the functions in the REPL.

## Overall impression

I really like the language. It's a functional language, so it's a bit different from what I'm used to, but it's really nice. I like the syntax, I like the way it works, I like the way it's structured.

### Pain points

- I'm not used to functional programming, so I had to think a bit more about how to do things.
- Recursion is a bit weird, but I think I got the hang of it.
- This is definitely not a language that wants to be closer to others. It's very different.

### Good things

- The language flows really well.
- The syntax is really nice.
- The documentation is really good. (Loved <https://elixirschool.com>)

I'll definitely keep it in mind for the future. And I'll probably use it for some personal projects.
