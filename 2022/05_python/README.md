# AOC - Day 05

This is my solution for day 05 of Advent of Code 2022. And today we are using [Python](https://www.python.org/).

## How to

Just run it with `python3 aoc.py`.

## Overall impression

I mean, it's python. It's a language I'm very familiar with, so it was pretty easy to do this. It's definitely the quickest and easiest language to do this kind of thing. But it has some drawbacks, like the complete mess with tools for formatting, linting, type checking, etc. And that's comming from a JS dev, so I'm used to that kind of mess.

### Pain points

- The language is not very fast, but it's not slow either.
- The syntax is not my favorite, but it's not bad either.
- The tooling is a mess, I had to instal like, 13 extensions to get a decent experience with type checking, linting, formatting, etc. And the MyPy extension is not very good, it keeps dying on me.

### Good things

- Everything is very easy to do and has 2^N examples on the internet.
- The language is very fast to write and iterate on.
- The language is very simple, making it very easy to learn and not worry about the language itself.

I's a stable for me when I need to do something quick and dirty, but I neither love it nor hate it at this point.
