# AOC - Day 1

This is my solution for day 1 of Advent of Code 2022. And today we are using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## How to

Just run it with `cargo run` or `cargo run --release` to try the release version.

## Overall impression

I love the language. Let's be honest it's a treat to write in Rust. From all and all in this solution as I implemented the custom Iterator from the Vec<32> struct I was able to achieve something close to what I was expecting, but with a dirty implementation of a cloning `sort` to be more functional, but keep in mind this is definitely not the best way to do it.
